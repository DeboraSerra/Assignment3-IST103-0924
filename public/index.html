          <h2 class="subtitle">The adoption</h2>
          <p>
            I like to joke that it was him who chose me, not the other way
            around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back then I wanted to adopt a cat, but a friend mentioned his dog
            had have some puppies and two were still looking for home. I decided
            to go and see the puppies, pretty much decided to adopt the one that
            was white with brown patches. Once I got there and tried to play
            with him, he got far away and layed down facing the other way. It
            couldn&apos;t be more clear, he didn&apos;t want anything to do with
            me.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, the cute brown puppy came closer and started
            playing with my shoe. And when I tried to pick him up he came and
            even slept in my arms. That was the moment I decided to postpone
            adopting a cat a chose Fred to live with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment he was still too young and couldn&apos;t leave his
            mom, so I waited and prepared until he was three months old so I
            could have him by my side!

          <h2 class="subtitle">Funniest stories</h2>
          <p>
            Little did I know that this cute puppy playing with my shoe was a
            bit of a monster! He had, and still has, so much energy and require
            a lot of play time to keep the house intact.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when he first arrived, I didn&apos;t know that. And I had a job
            that required me to leave the house every day. With that, somehow he
            managed to destroy the plaster on the wall, the pipes on the sink,
            countless hygienic pads and every single toy he had.
          </p>
          <p>
            One time I was so excited that I bought him this stuffed monkey that
            squeaked when he pressed it&apos;s arms and legs. He loved it!
            Carried it all around, like a little kid. The same day, when I came
            home from work, the monkey was in pieces. It was like a horror
            movie, with stuffing every where.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another time, I noticed that the internet stopped working and when I
            went to reset the router, there he was... Chewing the router outlet
            cable. I was so scared that something would happen to him at that
            time, that I scared him too. Until today he doesn&apos;t go near
            cables.

            Those a just a few of the many stories we had together for the past
            four years, and hopefully we will have many more in the years to
            come.

          <h2 class="subtitle">Curiosities about him</h2>
          <p>
            Fred is a very special dog. As people say that the dog always take
            after their tutor, he took after me and has many allergies, so I
            have to watch over him most of the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As unusual as it may sound, he is allergic to grass, chicken and cow
            protein, metal, dairy, and probably other things that I will find
            out eventually.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me a little over 3 years to discover this condition of his
            and realize that the health and skin problems he used to have
            constantly weren&apos;t my fault.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that I only manage to find that out because I moved back
            to my parents (a place with a huge backyard where he plays on the
            grass every single day) when he was 2 years old and because of the
            Instagram algorithm.

          <h2 class="subtitle">Where he is now</h2>
          <p>
            The most difficult decision that I made in my life was leave him
            behind to come to Canada. Even though he is in a place that he knows
            and is used to, with people that love him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only reason I was able to make this decision is because I am
            sure this time apart won&apos;t be for long and because my mom
            promised to take care of him just like I did (including the weekly
            bath with the special shampoo, the sardines, the skin inspections to
            see if his allergies are worse and everything else).
          </p>
          <p>
            Obs: Describing the pictures... The first one was the first sturdy
            toy I bought and he didn&apos;t manage to destroy it. The second one
            was the first week that he arrived, so cute and small. The third was
            almost 4 years latter, in the exact same position and the same face
            that he loves to make. The fourth photo is he, begging yto come to
            the couch and snuggle with me, because he knows he can only climb
            the furniture when he is called. And the last one is my last photo
            with him, moments before I left to the airport to come to Canada.
